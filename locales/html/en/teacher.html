<p>Evgeny Bushkov also carries out an active pedagogical activity, teaching violin at the faculty of Moscow Tchaikovsky cconservatory. Since 2019 he holds the position of the string instruments orchestral department chair at the Central Music School by the Moscow State Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky. He builds lessons around the main topics: how to approach a new work, study as efficiently as possible and make it so that sounds retrieved from the instrument were not just a performance, but the highest form of creativity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am convinced that when children make music, there is a special atmosphere. We were preparing for the final concert very seriously, I taught the guys to concentrate on the depth of sound. And the young people rehearsed with great enthusiasm: they are not just performed a piece but looked for a keyword, emotion, state or association and worked with it. Energy from sincere performances - extraordinary, it will be remembered by the viewer for many years", says Evgeny Bushkov.</p>
<p>Pupils joke about the teacher: out of the millions of sounds you make, he will surely hear at leaST one wrong one note. Now the guys hear the musical text not only from the point of view of melody and harmony, but they feel what emotions put the composer into his composition, and they try to play as beautifully as possible.</p>
