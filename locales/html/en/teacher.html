    “I am convinced that when children play music, there is a special atmosphere. We were preparing for the final concert very seriously, I
    taught the guys to concentrate on the depth of sound. And the young people rehearsed with great enthusiasm: they are not just
    performed a piece and looked for a keyword, emotion, state or association and worked with it. Energy from
    sincere performances - extraordinary, it will be remembered by the viewer for many years, ”says Evgeny Bushkov.
